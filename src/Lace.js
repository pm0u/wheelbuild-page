      <h4>Lacing</h4>
      <p>This is likely the most complicated and time consuming part of this process, don't be afraid to set things down and come back to them fresh.</p>
      <p>We will need to lay out a few concepts to ensure the next section makes sense:</p>

      <p> Spokes have directionality - this is either trailing or leading. In the picture to the right, if the wheel would be turning clockwise while mounted on a bike and moving forward, the trailing spokes are red and leading are blue</p>

      <p> Spokes can also have orientation - they can leave the hub on the outside or the inside of the hub flange</p>

      <p>The installation procedure for a spoke is as follows: thread spoke through hole in hub flange, insert nipple into rim in the appropriate spoke hole (where spoke should lead to), and thread nipple onto spoke a few turns (leave threads showing)</p>

        <h5>First Side</h5>
      <div className='col s12 l4'>
      Establish key spokes properly, this sets up everything else
Locate two spoke holes closest to centered on hub logo
Count 2, 4, 6, 8.. Put spokes in the hub flange holes labelled 8, opposite directions
These will be on either side of valve hole, put one directly against the valve hole, and other with one empty spoke hole btw it and the valve

      <Check>There should be two spokes in the hub, with 8 spokeholes between them. They should be opposite in orientation. At the rim, one should be installed in the spoke hole next to the rim and the other should have one empty spoke hole between it and the rim</Check>

      these spokes will cross 3 other spokes.

      <Check>Trace each outer spoke with your finger, ensure that it crosses 3 spokes and is <TT interlace text='interlaced' /> with the third. Trace it all the way to the rim, there should be an empty spoke hole on either side. The nearest spoke on both sides should be of the opposite direction</Check>

        <div className='col s12 l4'>
          Once again, getting first spoke right is most important part
          Spoke holes will be shifted slightly
Start with inner spokes
Find spoke that has an empty hole btw it and valve on rim, poke thru spoke holes in hub to find one that is offset towards that hole. Thatâ€™s the spoke that should go to there!
Install this spoke
Valve should be framed as pictured.
Use it as a guide for all other spokes on this side

      <Check>One spoke should be installed on the second side. It should leave the hub on the inside, and enter rim directly next to valve.</Check>

      <Check>At hub, there should be an empty spoke hole next to each installed spoke and they all leave the hub on the inside. At the rim, there are 3 spoke holes between each of these spokes (2 with spokes in them, 1 empty)</Check>

      <div className='row'>

      <Check>The final check -- trace every outside spoke on both sides. At the hub, it should have an inner spoke on either side of it. Trace it with your finger, it should cross 3 spokes on its way to the rim and interlace the last one.</Check>

    <p>If you've been following along and your wheel has passed every check... then congratulations! Your wheel is laced properly.</p>
