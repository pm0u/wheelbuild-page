      <h4>Tensioning</h4>
      <p>This is the final stage! Break out that truing stand, tensiometer, and chain lube. Put the wheel (yes, you can call it a wheel now!) in the truing stand and before beginning anything else, put a piece of tape where valve is to help keep reference. Beginning at the valve, put a small drop of chain lube at the base of every spoke nipple, where it touches the rim. This will help keep nipples easy to turn.</p>

    <p>In this stage we are going to tighten all the spokes so that the wheel is stiff and actually usable. The maximum tension that your wheel should have is determined by the rim, this information is usually available from the manufacturer (sometimes you have to call them). If no information is available, 80-100kgf is a safe range for most components</p>

    <p>We say max tension because unless your hub is completely symmetrical, the spokes on opposite sides are going to have different tension. The hub flange that is closer to the center of the hub is going to have a higher tension.</p>
